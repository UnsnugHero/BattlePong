# BattlePong

A spin on the classic game Pong written using the Love2D framework and Lua. This spin on Pong is of course the basic Pong game, but players can additionally shoot lasers at each other! What a twist.

If you want to run this game locally, you will need to have the Love2D framework on your machine. Simply download this repo and run  `love .` in the folder to run this game. An easier way to play it would be to download the executable from itch.io [here](https://unsnughero.itch.io/battle-pong);
